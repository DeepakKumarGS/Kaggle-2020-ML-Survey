## Excerpts from the notebook

In this notebook I have analysed different aspects related to TPU's(Tensor Processing Units) a new hardware accelator from Google-The responses of those who have selected TPU's as answer for the question Which type of specialization hardware do you use on a regular basis? was considered for analysis.The purpose of the notebook is to get an insight of the TPU users and answer few questions like,

Who are the TPU users ? Are they from all over the world or they belong to typical age group,come from a specific background etc ?
Are TPU Users also use GPU ? If so what percentage ?
From which country the majority of TPU usage comes from ?
What are the common problems for which the TPUs are used ? How does it differ from a regular user ?

After reading this notebook, I hope that you will be inspired to try out interesting problems using TPUs.
